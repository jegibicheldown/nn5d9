Since her breakthrough exhibition, BrookeAB has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. BrookeAB has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016. BrookeAB began her online journey in 2017, initially creating cosplay and gaming-related content. Her content gradually evolved, becoming increasingly sexually suggestive.
